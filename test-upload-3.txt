This is the third test file - testing after adding the INSERT policy for authenticated users.

The fix applied:
1. Added RLS policy to allow authenticated users to INSERT into job_queue
2. Granted EXECUTE permission on enqueue_job function to authenticated users

This should now work without 500 error!

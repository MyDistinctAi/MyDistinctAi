2. Downloading the Mistral 7B AI model
3. System requirements verification
4. Getting started with the app

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Desktop Onboarding Flow** (`DesktopOnboarding.tsx`)

  - Shows download button if not installed
  - Opens Ollama website in browser
  - Recheck button to verify installation
  - Clear warning message about requirement

#### Step 2: Download Mistral 7B Model
- **Checks**: If mistral:7b is downloaded

## 🎨 User Flow

### First-Time Desktop User:

1. **Opens desktop app for first time**
   - Sees login page (as configured in tauri.conf.json)

2. **Logs in successfully**
   - Redirected to /dashboard
   - Desktop onboarding modal appears (full screen overlay)

3. **Step 1: Ollama Check**
   - **If Ollama installed**: ✅ Auto-advance to Step 2
   - **If NOT installed**:
     - Shows warning message
     - "Download Ollama" button → Opens ollama.com in browser
     - User installs Ollama
     - Clicks "Recheck" button
     - Once detected → ✅ Advance to Step 2

4. **Step 2: Model Download**
   - **If Mistral 7B exists**: ✅ Auto-advance to Step 3
   - **If NOT downloaded**:
     - Shows model info (4.1 GB, 5-15 min)
     - "Download Mistral 7B" button
     - Progress bar shows percentage (simulated)
     - Once complete → ✅ Advance to Step 3

5. **Step 3: Complete**
   - Shows success message 🎉
   - "Get Started" button
   - Saves `desktop_onboarding_completed = true` to localStorage
   - Closes modal
   - Shows dashboard

6. **Future logins**
   - Onboarding never shows again
   - User sees dashboard immediately

---

## 💡 Smart Features

### 1. **Persistent State**
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('desktop_onboarding_completed', 'true')
```
- Saves completion status
- Never bothers user again
- Can be reset by clearing localStorage

### 2. **Auto-Detection**
```typescript
const status = await checkStatus() // Checks Ollama
const models = await listModels()   // Checks for Mistral
```
- Automatically checks Ollama status
- Automatically checks for models
- Skips steps if already complete

### 3. **Progress Simulation**
```typescript
const progressInterval = setInterval(() => {
  setDownloadProgress(prev => prev + 5)
}, 1000)
```
- Shows progress bar during model download
- Ollama doesn't provide real-time progress
- Simulated progress keeps user informed

### 4. **Skip Option**
```typescript
<Button variant="ghost" onClick={handleSkip}>
  Skip Setup
</Button>
```
- Advanced users can skip
- Still saves completion to localStorage
- Can manually install Ollama later

# RAG System Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: October 28, 2025, 4:49 AM - 4:55 AM  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installed ✅
```bash
npm install vectordb pdf-parse mammoth
```
- ✅ LanceDB for vector storage (though we're using Supabase pgvector)
- ✅ pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
- ✅ mammoth for DOCX text extraction

### 2. Core Services Created ✅

**Text Extraction Service** (`src/lib/text-extraction.ts`)
- ✅ Extract text from TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD, CSV files
- ✅ Handle both file extensions and MIME types
- ✅ Text chunking with overlap (1000 chars, 100 overlap)
- ✅ Download files from Supabase Storage
- ✅ Cleanup temp files

**Embedding Service** (`src/lib/embeddings/ollama-embeddings.ts`)
- ✅ Generate embeddings using Ollama's nomic-embed-text model
- ✅ Batch processing with progress callbacks
- ✅ Cosine similarity calculation
- ✅ Ollama connection testing

**Vector Storage** (`src/lib/vector-store.ts`)
- ✅ Already existed - uses Supabase pgvector
- ✅ Store embeddings in `document_embeddings` table
- ✅ Search similar documents with cosine similarity
- ✅ Get embedding stats

**LanceDB Client** (`src/lib/lancedb/client.ts`)
- ✅ Created but not used (Supabase pgvector is better for our use case)

### 3. Job Processing Updated ✅

**File Processing Job** (`src/app/api/jobs/process-next/route.ts`)
- ✅ Download file from storage
- ✅ Extract text based on file type
- ✅ Chunk text into segments
- ✅ Generate embeddings for each chunk
- ✅ Store embeddings in pgvector database
- ✅ Update training_data status to 'processed'
- ✅ Error handling and cleanup

### 4. RAG Service Updated ✅

**Context Retrieval** (`src/lib/rag-service.ts`)
- ✅ Generate embedding for user query
- ✅ Search pgvector for similar chunks
- ✅ Format context with similarity scores
- ✅ Graceful error handling (returns empty context instead of failing)

### 5. Database Fixed ✅

**Fixed `get_next_job()` Function**
- ✅ Fixed ambiguous column reference error
- ✅ Properly qualified all column names with table prefix
- ✅ Function now returns jobs correctly

## 📊 System Architecture

```
User uploads file
       ↓
File saved to Supabase Storage
       ↓
Job enqueued in job_queue table
       ↓
Worker calls /api/jobs/worker
       ↓
Worker calls /api/jobs/process-next
       ↓
get_next_job() returns pending job
       ↓
processFileJob() executes:
  1. Download file
  2. Extract text
  3. Chunk text (1000 chars)
  4. Generate embeddings (Ollama)
  5. Store in pgvector
       ↓
User asks question in chat
       ↓
retrieveContext() executes:
  1. Generate query embedding
  2. Search pgvector (cosine similarity)
  3. Return top 5 chunks
       ↓
Chat API adds context to prompt
       ↓
Ollama generates response with context
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Process Uploaded Files

Run the worker to process pending files:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:4000/api/jobs/worker
```

Or use the PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\run-worker.ps1
```

**Expected**: Files will be processed and embeddings stored in database

### Step 2: Verify Processing

Check if embeddings were created:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM document_embeddings;
```

**Expected**: Should show number of chunks created

### Step 3: Test RAG in Chat

1. Go to chat: `http://localhost:4000/dashboard/chat`
2. Ask: **"What is the secret code mentioned in the training documents?"**
3. **Expected Response**: AI should mention **"ALPHA-BRAVO-2025"**

### Step 4: Test Other Questions

Try these questions from `AI_TEST_PROMPTS.md`:
- "What port does the MyDistinctAI server run on?" → **4000**
- "How many jobs does the worker process per run?" → **10**
- "What is the test user's email address?" → **filetest@example.com**

## 📁 Files Created

1. ✅ `src/lib/text-extraction.ts` - Text extraction from files
2. ✅ `src/lib/embeddings/ollama-embeddings.ts` - Embedding generation
3. ✅ `src/lib/lancedb/client.ts` - LanceDB client (not used)
4. ✅ `RAG_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan
5. ✅ `AI_TEST_PROMPTS.md` - Test questions
6. ✅ `test-ai-knowledge.txt` - Test file with secret code

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/api/jobs/process-next/route.ts` - Added file processing logic
2. ✅ `src/lib/rag-service.ts` - Updated to use new embedding service
3. ✅ `tasks.md` - Added RAG implementation milestone
4. ✅ `claude.md` - Added session summary
5. ✅ Database: Fixed `get_next_job()` function

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Next Steps

### Current Status:
- ✅ All code implemented
- ✅ Database function fixed
- ⏳ **Need to test file processing**
- ⏳ **Need to verify RAG retrieval works**

### To Complete Testing:

1. **Run worker manually** to process the 3 pending files
2. **Check server logs** for processing progress
3. **Verify embeddings** were stored in database
4. **Test chat** with secret code question
5. **Verify AI response** includes context from files

### If Processing Fails:

Check these common issues:
- ✅ Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- ✅ nomic-embed-text model installed: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- ✅ Server is running on port 4000
- ✅ Files are accessible in Supabase Storage
- ✅ Database connection is working

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**RAG is working when**:
1. ✅ Worker processes files without errors
2. ✅ Embeddings are stored in `document_embeddings` table
3. ✅ Chat retrieves relevant context
4. ✅ AI mentions "ALPHA-BRAVO-2025" when asked about secret code
5. ✅ AI provides accurate answers from uploaded files

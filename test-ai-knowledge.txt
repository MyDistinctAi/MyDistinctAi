MyDistinctAI Project - AI Training Test Document

This document contains specific information to test if the AI can reference uploaded training data.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Project Name: MyDistinctAI
- Type: Privacy-first AI platform
- Technology Stack: Next.js 16, Supabase, Ollama, LanceDB
- Server Port: 4000
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. Authentication System
   - Email/password login
   - Magic link authentication
   - Xray route for testing (/xray/filetest)
   - Session management

2. Job Queue System
   - Database table: job_queue
   - Functions: enqueue_job, get_next_job, complete_job, fail_job
   - Worker endpoint: /api/jobs/worker
   - Background processing via cron job
   - Status tracking: pending, processing, completed, failed

3. File Upload System
   - Supports: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV
   - Maximum file size: 10MB
   - Storage: Supabase Storage
   - Automatic job enqueueing for processing

4. Chat Interface
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Ollama integration (Mistral 7B model)
   - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) support
   - Message history saved to database

SPECIFIC TEST INFORMATION:
- Test user email: filetest@example.com
- Test user password: password123456
- Test model name: Test File Upload Model
- Test model ID: 353608a6-c981-4dfb-9e75-c70fcdeeba2b
- Base AI model: mistral:7b

IMPORTANT NUMBERS TO REMEMBER:
- Dashboard stats show: 1 model, 3 training files, 1 chat session
- Job queue processes up to 10 jobs per run
- Worker runs every 60 seconds
- Session timeout: 7 days
- Maximum retry attempts for failed jobs: 3

RECENT FIXES:
1. Fixed dashboard stats to show real counts instead of 0
2. Fixed onboarding modal persistence issue
3. Fixed xray route for instant authentication
4. Fixed Ollama connection (changed mistral-7b to mistral:7b)
5. Implemented background job worker with PowerShell script

SECRET CODE FOR TESTING: ALPHA-BRAVO-2025

If the AI mentions this secret code, it means it successfully read and understood this training document!

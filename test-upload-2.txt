This is the second test file to verify the job queue fix is working.

After applying the migration to Supabase, the enqueue_job function should now work correctly.

This file should:
1. Upload successfully to Supabase Storage
2. Create a training_data record
3. Successfully enqueue a job without 500 error
4. Show "File processing job enqueued successfully" in console

## üîç How to Verify RAG is Working

**Signs that RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is working**:
1. ‚úÖ AI mentions specific details from the uploaded file
2. ‚úÖ AI references exact numbers (port 4000, 10 jobs, 60 seconds, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ AI mentions the secret code "ALPHA-BRAVO-2025"
4. ‚úÖ AI provides project-specific information not in its general training

**Signs that RAG is NOT working**:
1. ‚ùå AI gives generic answers
2. ‚ùå AI says "I don't have information about that"
3. ‚ùå AI doesn't mention the secret code
4. ‚ùå AI provides incorrect or made-up details

## üìä Test Results Template

After testing, record your results:

| Test # | Prompt | Expected | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Secret code | ALPHA-BRAVO-2025 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 2 | Server port | 4000 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 3 | Jobs per run | 10 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 4 | Test user email | filetest@example.com | ___ | ‚¨ú |

| 6 | Dashboard stats | 1, 3, 1 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 7 | Worker schedule | 60 seconds | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 8 | Max file size | 10MB | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 9 | Session timeout | 7 days | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 10 | Tech stack | Next.js 16, Supabase, etc. | ___ | ‚¨ú |

## üéØ RECOMMENDED FIRST TEST

**Start with Test #1 (Secret Code)** - This is the most definitive test because:
- The code "ALPHA-BRAVO-2025" is unique to your uploaded file
- It's not something the AI would know from general training
- If the AI mentions it, RAG is definitely working
- If the AI doesn't mention it, RAG needs debugging

**Example conversation**:
```
You: What is the secret code mentioned in the training documents?

AI (if RAG works): The secret code mentioned in the training documents is ALPHA-BRAVO-2025.

AI (if RAG doesn't work): I don't see any secret code in the information provided. Could you clarify what you're referring to?
```

## üîß If Tests Fail

If the AI doesn't reference the uploaded file:

1. **Check if file was processed**:
   - Look for "File processing job enqueued successfully" in console
   - Check job_queue table for processing status

2. **Run the background worker**:
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/jobs/worker
   ```

3. **Check RAG service**:
   - Verify LanceDB is set up
   - Check if embeddings were created
   - Look for RAG-related errors in server logs

4. **Verify model has training data**:
   - Check training_data table
   - Ensure files are linked to correct model_id

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**RAG is working if**:
- AI correctly answers at least 7/10 test questions
- AI mentions the secret code "ALPHA-BRAVO-2025"
- AI provides specific numbers from the document
- AI references project-specific details

**Status**: Ready to test! üöÄ

## 🎯 Comparison: With vs Without RAG

### Question: "What is the secret code for testing?"

**Without RAG** (General AI knowledge):
```
I don't have information about any specific secret code
for testing. Could you provide more context?
```
❌ Generic response, no useful information

**With RAG** (This test):
```
The secret code for testing, according to the provided
documents, is "ALPHA-BRAVO-2025".
```
✅ Specific, accurate, sourced response

### This proves RAG is:
- ✅ **Working** - Retrieves correct context
- ✅ **Accurate** - Gives exact information
- ✅ **Transparent** - Shows source of knowledge
- ✅ **Valuable** - Provides information AI wouldn't know otherwise

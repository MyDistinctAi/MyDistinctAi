## ADR-001: Privacy-First Architecture with Local AI Processing

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**:  Accepted

### Context
Users are increasingly concerned about data privacy, especially when using AI tools. Traditional AI platforms send user data to external servers for processing, creating privacy and security risks.

### Decision
Build a privacy-first platform where all AI processing happens locally on the user's machine using Ollama and open-source models.

### Rationale
- **Privacy**: User data never leaves their machine
- **Control**: Users have full control over their data
- **Compliance**: Easier GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Cost**: No per-request API costs for AI inference
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection

### Alternatives Considered

1. **OpenAI API**
   - L Data sent to external servers
   - L Privacy concerns
   - L Ongoing API costs
   -  More powerful models
   -  No local setup required

2. **Cloud-hosted open-source models**
   - L Still requires sending data externally
   -  More accessible
   - L Hosting costs

### Trade-offs
- **Pros**:
  - Maximum privacy and security
  - No recurring AI API costs
  - Works offline
  - Full data control

- **Cons**:
  - Requires local GPU/CPU power
  - Users must install Ollama
  - Limited to models that run locally
  - Initial setup complexity

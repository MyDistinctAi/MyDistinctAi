# RAG System Debugging Session - Final Summary

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Duration**: ~12 hours  
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUE REMAINS**

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### ✅ Complete RAG System Built:
1. Text extraction service (TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD, CSV)
2. Ollama embeddings integration (nomic-embed-text, 768 dimensions)
3. Vector storage in Supabase pgvector
4. Job queue system for background processing
5. RAG retrieval service
6. Chat API integration

### ✅ Bugs Fixed:
1. Port configuration (now always 4000)
2. `useRAG` flag forced to `true`
3. Ollama started and running
4. Embedding parameter fixed (array instead of JSON string)
5. Job type corrected (`file_processing`)
6. Job payload structure fixed
7. Comprehensive logging added

### ✅ Files Created:
- ~1500 lines of production code
- 15+ documentation files
- Multiple test scripts
- SQL reset scripts

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE

### The Problem:
**`match_documents()` returns 0 matches even with:**
- ✅ Threshold 0.0
- ✅ 6 embeddings in database
- ✅ Ollama running
- ✅ Query embedding generated (768 dimensions)
- ✅ Same model (nomic-embed-text)

### Evidence:
```
[Vector Store] Calling match_documents with:
  - Model ID: 353608a6-c981-4dfb-9e75-c70fcdeeba2b
  - Embedding length: 768
  - Threshold: 0
[Vector Store] RPC result: { data: [], error: null }
[Vector Store] ✅ Found 0 matches
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Hypothesis

### Possible Causes:
1. **Embedding vectors are incompatible** - Even though both use Ollama nomic-embed-text, the vectors might be in different formats or normalized differently
2. **Database function issue** - The `match_documents` function might have a bug
3. **Model ID mismatch** - Embeddings might be stored with wrong model_id
4. **File with secret code not processed** - The test-ai-knowledge.txt file might have failed to process

---

## 📊 Current State

### Database:
- ✅ 6 embeddings stored
- ✅ pgvector extension enabled
- ✅ `match_documents()` function exists
- ❌ Returns 0 matches for any query

### Processing:
- ✅ 4 jobs processed
- ❌ 4 jobs failed
- ⚠️  Only 6 embeddings (should be ~8 for all files)

### Files:
- test-upload.txt
- test-upload-2.txt
- test-upload-3.txt
- test-ai-knowledge.txt ← **Contains secret code**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps to Debug

### 1. Verify Which Files Were Processed
```sql
SELECT 
  td.file_name,
  COUNT(de.id) as embedding_count
FROM training_data td
LEFT JOIN document_embeddings de ON de.training_data_id = td.id
WHERE td.model_id = '353608a6-c981-4dfb-9e75-c70fcdeeba2b'
GROUP BY td.file_name;
```

### 2. Check if Secret Code is in Database
```sql
SELECT chunk_text 
FROM document_embeddings 
WHERE chunk_text LIKE '%ALPHA-BRAVO%';
```

### 3. Test match_documents Directly
```sql
-- Get a sample embedding
SELECT embedding FROM document_embeddings LIMIT 1;

-- Test if it matches itself
SELECT * FROM match_documents(
  (SELECT embedding FROM document_embeddings LIMIT 1),
  '353608a6-c981-4dfb-9e75-c70fcdeeba2b'::uuid,
  5,
  0.0
);
```

### 4. Check Embedding Format
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  array_length(embedding::float[], 1) as dimensions,
  substring(chunk_text, 1, 50) as preview
FROM document_embeddings
LIMIT 5;
```

## 💡 Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Re-process with Logging
Add more logging to the embedding generation to see exact values:
- Log first 5 values of each embedding
- Log vector magnitude/norm
- Compare stored vs query embeddings

### Solution 2: Test Different Similarity Function
The `match_documents` function uses cosine similarity. Try:
- L2 distance
- Inner product
- Different similarity thresholds

### Solution 3: Verify Ollama Model
```bash
ollama list
ollama show nomic-embed-text
```

Check if model version changed or if there are multiple versions.

### Solution 4: Manual Embedding Comparison
Generate two embeddings for the same text and compare:
```javascript
const emb1 = await generateEmbedding("test");
const emb2 = await generateEmbedding("test");
// Should be identical or very similar
```

## 📝 Technical Details

### What Works:
- ✅ Ollama API (http://localhost:11434)
- ✅ Embedding generation (768 dimensions)
- ✅ Database storage
- ✅ RPC calls (no errors)
- ✅ Job processing (partially)

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Vector similarity search
- ❌ RAG context retrieval
- ❌ AI referencing training data

### The Mystery:
Why does `match_documents` return 0 results when:
1. Embeddings exist in database
2. Query embedding is generated successfully
3. Threshold is 0.0 (should match everything)
4. No errors are thrown

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Vector embeddings are fragile** - Small changes in model/version can break compatibility
2. **Logging is essential** - Without detailed logs, debugging vector search is nearly impossible
3. **Test at every layer** - Database, API, integration all need separate tests
4. **Threshold 0.0 should match** - If it doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Action

**IMMEDIATE**: Run the SQL queries above to:
1. Confirm secret code is in database
2. Test if embeddings match themselves
3. Check embedding dimensions and format

**If embeddings match themselves**: The issue is with query embedding generation

**If embeddings DON'T match themselves**: The issue is with the `match_documents` function or vector storage

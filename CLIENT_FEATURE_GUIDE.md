### 4. Token Tracking in Action
**Location**: Every chat interaction

**How it works**:
1. User sends message to AI
2. System checks usage limit (blocks if exceeded)
3. AI responds with answer
4. Tokens automatically counted and logged
5. Usage updated in database
6. Dashboard widget updates in real-time

**What's logged**:
- User ID
- Tokens used
- Model ID
- Session ID
- Request type (chat, training, embedding)
- Model name (mistral, gpt-4, etc.)
- Timestamp

**Monthly Reset**:
- Usage resets automatically on the 1st of each month
- Previous month's data retained for history

---

### 5. GPT API Integration
**Location**: Backend (automatic routing)

**How it works**:
- **Default**: Ollama (local, privacy-first)
- **Optional**: GPT (cloud, when API key configured)
- **Routing**: Automatically selects best provider

**To enable GPT**:
1. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_GPT=true
   ```
2. Restart server
3. Chat requests will use GPT instead of Ollama

**Models available**:
- GPT-4 (best quality, $0.03/1K tokens)
- GPT-4 Turbo (faster, $0.01/1K tokens)
- GPT-3.5 Turbo (fastest, $0.0015/1K tokens)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Recommendations)

### 1. LiteLLM Integration (Suggested)
**What**: More accurate token counting and cost tracking
**Why**: Better billing accuracy, real-time cost estimates
**Effort**: ~2 hours

### 2. Email Notifications
**What**: Send email when usage hits 80% or 90%
**Why**: Users notified even when not logged in
**Effort**: ~1 hour (using Supabase Edge Functions)

### 3. Pay-as-you-go at 90%
**What**: Auto-purchase token packages at 90% usage
**Why**: Revenue bump, no service interruption
**Effort**: ~3 hours (Stripe integration)

### 4. Usage Analytics Dashboard
**What**: Charts showing daily/weekly/monthly usage
**Why**: Better insights for users
**Effort**: ~4 hours

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **GPT API Key**: Not configured yet (optional feature)
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local` to enable

2. **Token Estimation**: Using rough estimate (1 token ≈ 4 chars)
   - Will be more accurate with LiteLLM integration

3. **Nudge Persistence**: Stored in database, not browser
   - Users won't see nudge again until next threshold

4. **Testing**: Playwright tests written but not run yet
   - Need to test with real user data

---

## 📊 Database Changes

### New Tables (3):
1. `usage_tracking` - Monthly usage per user
2. `plan_metadata` - Plan limits and pricing
3. `token_usage_log` - Detailed request logs

### New Functions (3):
1. `log_token_usage()` - Log tokens after each request
2. `get_user_usage()` - Get current usage with plan limits
3. `update_nudge_sent()` - Record nudge sent to user

### To apply:
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: scripts/002_token_tracking_system.sql
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these to measure success:

1. **Upgrade Conversion Rate**:
   - Users who see nudge → click upgrade → complete purchase

2. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Average tokens per user
   - Peak usage times
   - Most common nudge threshold

3. **Plan Distribution**:
   - % Starter vs Professional vs Enterprise
   - Average lifetime value per plan

4. **Feature Adoption**:
   - % users viewing privacy settings
   - % users with GPT vs Ollama

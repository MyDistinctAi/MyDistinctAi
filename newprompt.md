  (Server)

  Add per-user token tracking:

  Each API request logs user_id, tokens_used, and timestamp into Supabase.

  Running tally resets monthly (or per billing cycle).

  2️⃣ Supabase (Database)

  Usage table:

  user_id | month | tokens_used | last_nudge_sent

  Plan metadata table:

  plan_name | monthly_cap | overage_price

  3️⃣ Nudge Logic (Backend)

  After each request:
  usage_pct = tokens_used / monthly_cap
  if usage_pct in [0.5, 0.8, 0.9]:
      send_nudge_event(user_id, usage_pct)
  4️⃣ Frontend (Dashboard)

  Listens for nudge_event → Shows inline banner:

  "You're at 80% of your monthly tokens. Upgrade now to avoid slowdowns."

  Progress bar + “Upgrade” button always visible in usage section.

  5️⃣ Payment Flow

  “Upgrade” button links to Stripe checkout with correct plan preselected.
  Here’s the 3-tier upgrade nudge copy (written to feel helpful, urgent, and positive instead of
  “corporate pushy.”)

  📊 50% Usage — “Awareness” Nudge

  “Halfway there! You’ve used 50% of your monthly tokens. Looks like you’re really putting your AI to     
  work 🚀. Upgrade anytime to unlock more.”
  CTA: Upgrade Plan (subtle, secondary color)

  ⚡ 80% Usage — “Prevention” Nudge

  “Heads up — you’ve reached 80% of your monthly tokens. Upgrade now so your AI keeps running at full     
  speed without interruptions.”
  CTA: Upgrade Now (primary color, but not red — use your brand accent)

  🔥 90% Usage — “Urgency” Nudge

  “You’re almost at your monthly limit — only 10% tokens left. Upgrade now to keep your AI flowing        
  without slowdown or reset.”
  CTA: Secure More Tokens (primary color, animated subtle pulse)

  💡 Tip:

  Place these inside the dashboard usage widget, not as pop-ups — it feels less like a hard sell.

  Do you feel as though I should add an extra revenue bump, the 90% nudge could also offer pay-as-you-go  
  (Just a thought).
  let me know your thoughts on these. We can always use pre-built tools i.e. Use pre-built tools, and     
  roll out GPT-4 now:
  LiteLLM (tracks tokens/costs).
  Stripe’s usage billing (auto-charges overages).
  Thanks -
